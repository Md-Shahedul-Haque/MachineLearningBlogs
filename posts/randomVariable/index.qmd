# Random Variable in Machine Learning

A random variable (stochastic variable) is a real valued function from the domain of the sample space of a defined experiment. Generally, a random variable is denoted by capital letter (usually $X$ ) where small letter ($x$) denotes the observed value. For example, $X$ be the measurement of number of heads observed in an experiment of tossing two coins. Here, the sample space $S$ is:

$$ S = {(H, H), (H, T), (T, H), (T, T) } $$

This 4 possible outcomes of this experiment constitute the domain of \$X\$. For each outcome, the random variable is calculates in this way:

$$  X(H, H) = 2  $$\$\$ X(H, T) = 1 \$\$

$$  X(T, H) = 1 $$ \$\$ X(T, T) = 0 \$\$

## Types of Random Variable

In broader way, there are two categories of random variable:

1.  Discrete Random Variable: Range of the observable value is a finite set. For instance, in the previous two coins tossing $X$ is a discrete random variable with observable values $\{0, 1, 2\}$ .

2.  Continuous Random Variable: Range of the observable value has some interval, bounded or unbounded. For instance, weight of different people in a class.

### Density Functions

### **Probability Mass Function** **(PMF)**

The probability mass function (PMF) a discrete random variable is the likelihood that the variable takes on a given value. Mathematically,\
$$  f(x) = P(X = x) $$

which follows the following properties:

$$  f(x) \geq 0 \mbox{ for any $x$ \(\epsilon\)
$S$ } $$\

$$  \sum_{x \epsilon S} f(x) = 1  $$

Code snippet for calculating PMF of a discrete random variable which follows binomial distribution:

Then we can plot the PMF of that variable better visualization

### **Probability Density Function** **(PDF)**

The probability density function (PDF) of a continuous random variable is the likelihood that the variable lies on a given range. Mathematically,\
$$ \int_{a}^{b} f(x)dx = P(a< X <b) \mbox{ for any $a, b$ \(\epsilon\) $S$ satisfying a < b }$$

which follows the following properties:

$$  f(x) \geq 0 \mbox{ for any $x$ \(\epsilon\)
$S$ } $$

$$  \int_{x \epsilon S} f(x)dx = 1  $$

Code snippet for calculating PDF of a continuous random variable which follows normal distribution:

{{< embed rv_visual.ipynb#pdf-normal echo=true >}}

Then we can plot the PDF of that variable better visualization

### **Cumulative Distribution Function** **(CDF)**

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a random variable is the likelihood that the variable is bounded within a given value. Mathematically,

$$ F(x) = \sum_{z \epsilon S, z \leq x } f(z) \mbox{ for discrete random variables }$$\
$$ F(x) = \int_{- \infty}^{x} f(z)dz  \mbox{ for continuous random variables }$$

Furthermore,

$$  P(a< X \leq b) = F(b) - F(a)  $$
