    "text": "2 Linear Regression\nLinear regression is used for predictive analysis. It is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between the criterion or the scalar response and the multiple predictors or explanatory variables. Linear regression focuses on the conditional probability distribution of the response given the values of the predictors.\n\n2.1 Formula for Linear Regression Model\nThe simplest form of linear regression involved only one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for simple linear regression is:\n\\[\ny=\\theta x+b\n\\]\nwhere,\n\n\\(y\\) is the dependent variable\n\\(x\\) is the independent variable\n\\(\\theta\\) is the model weights or parameters\n\\(b\\) is the bias\n\nMultiple Linear Regression involves more than one independent variable and one dependent variable. The equation for multiple linear regression is:\n\\[\ny=b+\\theta_1 x_1+\\theta_2 x_2+\\theta_3 x_3+...+\\theta_n x_n\n\\]\nwhere,\n\n\\(y\\) is the dependent variable\n\\(x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n\\) are the independent variables\n\\(\\theta_1, \\theta_2, ..., \\theta_n\\) are the model weights or parameters\n\\(b\\) is the bias\n\n\n\n2.2 Assumption for Linear Regression Model\nA linear regression model needs to meet a few conditions in order to be accurate and dependable solutions:\n\nLinearity: Linear relation between independent and dependent variable\nIndependence: Observations in the dataset are independent of each other.\nHomoscedasticity: Amount of the independent variable(s) has no impact on the variance of the errors\nNormality: The residuals should be normally distributed\nNo Multicollinearity: No high correlation between the independent variables.\n\n\n\n2.3 California Housing dataset\nWe will be using California Housing dataset for visualizing regression models. This dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census block group. Code snippet for loading this dataset and checking its description:\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pylab as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn import datasets\n\n# Load the California Housing dataset\ncalifornia_housing = datasets.fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)\n\nprint(california_housing.DESCR)\n\n# Load the California Housing dataset as a DataFrame\ndf_california_housing = california_housing.frame\n\n# Display the first few entries of the DataFrame\nprint(df_california_housing.head())\n\n.. _california_housing_dataset:\n\nCalifornia Housing dataset\n--------------------------\n\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\n\n    :Number of Instances: 20640\n\n    :Number of Attributes: 8 numeric, predictive attributes and the target\n\n    :Attribute Information:\n        - MedInc        median income in block group\n        - HouseAge      median house age in block group\n        - AveRooms      average number of rooms per household\n        - AveBedrms     average number of bedrooms per household\n        - Population    block group population\n        - AveOccup      average number of household members\n        - Latitude      block group latitude\n        - Longitude     block group longitude\n\n    :Missing Attribute Values: None\n\nThis dataset was obtained from the StatLib repository.\nhttps://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~ltorgo/Regression/cal_housing.html\n\nThe target variable is the median house value for California districts,\nexpressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars ($100,000).\n\nThis dataset was derived from the 1990 U.S. census, using one row per census\nblock group. A block group is the smallest geographical unit for which the U.S.\nCensus Bureau publishes sample data (a block group typically has a population\nof 600 to 3,000 people).\n\nA household is a group of people residing within a home. Since the average\nnumber of rooms and bedrooms in this dataset are provided per household, these\ncolumns may take surprisingly large values for block groups with few households\nand many empty houses, such as vacation resorts.\n\nIt can be downloaded/loaded using the\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing` function.\n\n.. topic:: References\n\n    - Pace, R.

    "text": "3 Nonlinear Regression\nNonlinear regression is a statistical technique which assists in describing the non linearity in relationship between independent and dependent variables. Nonlinear regression models are described with a nonlinear equation. Typically, nonlinear regression is well suited to explain relations between variables in real life data. There are a lot of nonlinear regression models, refer to the previously mentioned list of regression techniques in section Section 1 if needed. In the scope of this blog, we confine our discussions to two types of nonlinear regression.\n\n3.1 Support Vector Regressor (SVR)\nSupport vector regression (SVR) is a type of support vector machine (SVM) that is used for regression tasks. It attempts to find a function that best predicts the continuous output value of target for given input values of independent variables. SVR can have both linear and non-linear kernels. We will be using a radial basis function (RBF) kernel which is a non linear one.\nCode snippet for scaling the values of feature so that features with higher values can not dominate the lower value ones. Feature scaling is a must for SVR to speed up convergence and improve model performance. Also we scale the target values accordingly:\n\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n# Standardize the features\nscaler_X = StandardScaler()\nX_train_scaled = scaler_X.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test_scaled = scaler_X.transform(X_test)\n\n# Standardize the target variable\nscaler_y = StandardScaler()\n# Reshape the target variable to a 1D array\ny_train_scaled = scaler_y.fit_transform(y_train.values.reshape(-1, 1)).ravel()\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nSimilar to our prior example, we create the regression model at first:\n\n\n# Create an SVR model on RBF kernel\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVR\nmodel = SVR(kernel='rbf', C=100, gamma=0.1, epsilon=0.1)\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train_scaled.ravel())\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred_scaled = model.predict(X_test_scaled)\n\n# Inverse transform the predictions to the original scale\ny_pred = scaler_y.inverse_transform(y_pred_scaled.reshape(-1, 1)).ravel()\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nThen, we utilize the predefined function to evaluate the performance of this nonlinear regression model:\n\n\nperformance_stat(y_test, y_pred)\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.46\nMean Squared Error (MSE): 0.45\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.67\nR-squared (R²): 0.66\n\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nHere, we can see \\(R^2\\) of \\(0.66\\) which means that the model explains about \\(66\\%\\) of the variance in the target variable. So this model performs better than the previous model.\nNext, we plot predictions by this model with respect to the actual data:\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))  # Set a square figure size\n# Plot y_pred in red\nplt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='red', label='Predicted', alpha=0.1)\n\n# Plot y_test as a line for reference\nplt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], linestyle='--', color='green', linewidth=2, label='Actual')\n\nplt.xlabel('Actual Median House Value')\nplt.ylabel('Predicted Median House Value')\nplt.title('SVR (RBF Kernel) on California Housing Dataset')\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Noninear Regression (SVR with RBF Kernel) on the California Housing dataset\n\n\n\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nSince the red dots (predicted data) is closer to the green (actual data) line, this model can predict the target variable well.\n\n\n3.2 Random Forest Regressor\nRandom Forest Regression is a versatile technique for predicting numerical values. To reduce overfitting and improve overall accuracy, It combines the predictions of multiple decision trees.\nSimilar to our previous example, we create the regression model at first:\n\n\n# Create a Random Forest Regressor\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nmodel = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)\n\n# Train the model\nmodel.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# Make predictions on the test set\ny_pred = model.predict(X_test)\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nThen, we use the predefined performance function to evaluate the this nonlinear regression model:\n\n\nperformance_stat(y_test, y_pred)\n\nMean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.46\nMean Squared Error (MSE): 0.42\nRoot Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 0.65\nR-squared (R²): 0.68\n\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nHere, we can see \\(R^2\\) of \\(0.68\\) which means that the model explains about \\(0.68\\%\\) of the variance in the target variable. So this model performs better than the previous models.\nNext, we plot predictions by this model with respect to the actual data:\n\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))  # Set a square figure size\n# Plot y_pred in red\nplt.scatter(y_test, y_pred, color='red', label='Predicted', alpha=0.1)\n\n# Plot y_test as a line for reference\nplt.plot([y_test.min(), y_test.max()], [y_test.min(), y_test.max()], linestyle='--', color='green', linewidth=2, label='Actual')\n\nplt.xlabel('Actual Median House Value')\nplt.ylabel('Predicted Median House Value')\nplt.title('Random Forest Regressor on California Housing Dataset')\n\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Noninear Regression (Random Forest Regressor) on the California Housing dataset\n\n\n\n\nSource: Linear and Nonlinear Regression with scikit-learn Library\nSince the red dots (predicted data) is closer to the green (actual data) line, this model can predict the target variable very well."

For instance, given an image the model categorize which type of dress it is.\n\nDepending on the nature of relationship (linear or nonlinear) between independent and dependent variables, classification can be considered two types:\n\nLinear Classifications: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (with kernel = ‘linear’), Single-layer Perceptron, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier\nNon-linear Classifications: K-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Ensemble learning Classifier (Random Forests, Adaboost, Bagging Classifier, Voting Classifier, ExtraTrees Classifier), Multi-layer Artificial Neural Networks\n\nOn the basis of learners, classification can be divided into two types:\n\nLazy Learners: They are instance-based learners since they do not learn a model during the training phase. Instead, they simply store the training data and use it to classify new instances at prediction time. As a result, It is very fast at prediction time because it does not require computations during the predictions. On the other hand, it is less effective in high-dimensional spaces or when the number of training instances is large. Examples include k-nearest neighbors and case-based reasoning.\nEager Learners:They are model-based learners as they learn a model from the training data during the training phase and use this model to classify new instances at prediction time. Consequently, it is slower at prediction time but it is more effective in high-dimensional spaces having large training datasets. Examples of eager learners include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines."

But its application is also observed in regression problems, and even outlier detection tasks. SVM algorithms are very effective as they try to find the maximum separating hyperplane between the different classes available in the target feature.\nWe utilize the scikit-learn machine library to create our SVM model with linear kernel. Before training we perform feature scaling which is a must for SVM to speed up convergence and improve model performance. Code snippet for this is:\n\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n# Standardize the features\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)\nX_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)\n\n# Create an SVM model on linear kernel\nfrom sklearn import svm\nsvm_clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')  # Linear Kernel\n# train the model\nsvm_clf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)\n# make predictions\nsvm_clf_pred = svm_clf.predict(X_test_scaled)\n\n\nSource: Classification with scikit-learn Library\n\n\n4.3 Naive Bayes Classifier\nNaive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. Such classifiers has strict assumption that every pair of features is independent of each other. Also they require that each features provide an independent and equal contribution to the outcome\nCode snippet for creating a gaussian naive bayes classifier model:\n\n\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n# Create an NB model\ngnb = GaussianNB()\n# train the model\ngnb.fit(X_train, y_train)\n# make predictions\ngnb_pred = gnb.predict(X_test)\n\nSource: Classification with scikit-learn Library\n\n\n4.4 Decision Tree Classifier\nDecision tree is a versatile supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. It consists of a flowchart-like tree structure. Here, each internal node denotes a test on an attribute, each branch represents an outcome of the test. Each leaf node (terminal node) holds a class label. During training, it is constructed by recursively splitting the training data into subsets based on the values of the attributes until a stopping criterion is met, such as the maximum depth of the tree or the minimum number of samples required to split a node.\nCode snippet for creating a decision tree classifier model:\n\n\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n\n# Create an DTC model\ndt = DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state=42)\n# train the model\ndt.fit(X_train, y_train)\n# make predictions\ndt_pred = dt.predict(X_test)\n\nSource: Classification with scikit-learn Library\n\n\n4.5 Performance Evaluation\nLater, we evaluate the performance of the models:\n\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report\n\n# Evaluate the models\nsvm_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, svm_clf_pred)\ndt_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, dt_pred)\ngnb_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, gnb_pred)\n\n# Create a DataFrame for classification reports\nclassification_reports = pd.DataFrame(columns=['accuracy', 'precision', 'recall', 'f1-score'])\n\n# Classification Report for SVM\nsvm_classification_report = classification_report(y_test, svm_clf_pred, output_dict=True)\nsvm_metrics = [svm_accuracy, svm_classification_report['0']['precision'], svm_classification_report['0']['recall'], svm_classification_report['0']['f1-score']]\nclassification_reports.loc['Support Vector Machine'] = svm_metrics\n\n# Classification Report for Naive Bayes\nnb_classification_report = classification_report(y_test, gnb_pred, output_dict=True)\nnb_metrics = [gnb_accuracy, nb_classification_report['0']['precision'], nb_classification_report['0']['recall'], nb_classification_report['0']['f1-score']]\nclassification_reports.loc['Naive Bayes'] = nb_metrics\n\n# Classification Report for Decision Tree\ntree_classification_report = classification_report(y_test, dt_pred, output_dict=True)\ntree_metrics = [dt_accuracy, tree_classification_report['0']['precision'], tree_classification_report['0']['recall'], tree_classification_report['0']['f1-score']]\nclassification_reports.loc['Decision Tree'] = tree_metrics\n\n# Display the DataFrame\nprint(classification_reports)\n\n               accuracy  precision  recall  f1-score\nSVM            0.966667        1.0     1.0       1.0\nDecision Tree  1.000000        1.0     1.0       1.0\nNaive Bayes    1.000000        1.0     1.0       1.0\n\n\nSource: Classification with scikit-learn Library\nSince, the dataset is too small, performance of the models are pretty close except Support Vector Machine.
